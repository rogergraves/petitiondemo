Models included User, Petition and Signature.\r\n\r\nPetition\r\n\r\n* title\r\n* description\r\n* user_id\r\n\t\r\nUser\r\n\r\n* name\r\n* password\r\n* email\r\n\t\r\nSignatures\r\n\r\n* user_id\r\n* petition_id\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nI used rspec for the model validations.\r\n\r\n### Comments\r\nI made some mistakes in generating devise and after it turned into a yak shaving exercise I decided to nuke it and start over. It put me behind around 25 minutes (probably just getting warmed up was part of the initial delay too).\r\n"}
